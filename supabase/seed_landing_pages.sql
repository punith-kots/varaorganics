-- ⚠️ CONFIRM BEFORE LAUNCH:
--  * Variant prices in this copy (250ml ₹749, 1L ₹2,599) differ from the
--    catalog (₹799 / ₹2,699). The catalog is authoritative for anything
--    charged — reconcile before these pages go live.
--  * The comparison table names competitors with prices and "Not published"
--    claims. Comparative advertising requires dated evidence on file.
--  * Lab/accreditation and farm details are owner-supplied and must be
--    substantiated (Jagdamba Laboratories, ISO 9001:2015, GLP, FSSAI 2017).
