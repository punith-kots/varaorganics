        question: "What is Vara Organic?",
        answer:
          "Vara Organic is a direct-to-consumer food brand by Varixa Global Ventures Private Limited, Bengaluru. We source A2 Gir Cow Bilona Ghee, Raw Wild Forest Honey, and traditional Wood Pressed Oils from family-owned farms across India and deliver them to your kitchen. Every product is independently tested at a NABL-certified laboratory before it ships.",
      },
      {
        question: "Where is Vara Organic based?",
        answer:
          "We are based in Bengaluru, Karnataka. Our ghee and honey are sourced from Kota, Rajasthan. Our wood pressed oils come from a traditional wooden ghani facility in Bengaluru.",
      },
      {
        question: "Who started Vara Organic and why?",
        answer:
          "I started Vara Organic because I could not find what I was looking for during my pregnancy. When I was expecting my daughter, I became very careful about everything I ate. Ghee was the one food every doctor, every elder, every article agreed on — good ghee, made the right way, is genuinely nourishing. So I went looking for it. What I found was labels: Pure A2, Bilona method, Farm fresh. All of it was printed with confidence, but none of it was verifiable. I asked brands for lab reports. Most did not have them. I asked where the cows were. Nobody could tell me. I visited stores in Bengaluru, ordered online, and read every ingredient panel — but I still could not answer the most basic question a pregnant woman should be able to answer about the food she is eating: is what is on this label actually in this jar? That question stayed with me after my daughter was born. I started tracing the supply chain myself. I found farms and a government-approved laboratory in Jaipur that tests across 70 parameters. I asked one question to every supplier — will you let me publish the lab report on the jar? The ones who said yes became Vara. Vara means gift in Sanskrit. It started as a gift to my daughter — the certainty that what she was eating was exactly what the label said. It became a brand because I was not the only mother asking the same question.",
      },
      {
        question: "What does Vara mean?",
        answer:
          "Vara is a Sanskrit word meaning gift or boon. It was chosen because the brand started as a gift — a promise to one child that her food was pure. It became a brand because many families were asking the same question.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is Vara Organic a registered company?",
        answer:
          "Yes. Vara Organic is the consumer brand of Varixa Global Ventures Private Limited — a registered private limited company in Karnataka. We hold FSSAI Central Licence No. 11226998000505, valid until 02 August 2027.",

        question: "Why should I choose Vara over other A2 ghee brands?",
        answer:
          "Every A2 ghee brand makes similar claims — bilona method, farm sourced, pure. Vara shows you the actual lab report for your product. Scan the QR code on any Vara jar to see the Jagdamba Laboratories report, including moisture content, butyric acid levels, antibiotic test results, heavy metal levels, and adulteration markers.",
      },
      {
        question: "How is Vara different from other A2 ghee brands?",
        answer:
          "The established brands have better recognition than us. We are new and we acknowledge that openly. The difference is one thing — verifiability. Most brands say lab tested, claim the bilona method, and say A2 Gir cow. We say these things too, but we also show you the actual numbers. Every Vara product carries a QR code on the label. Scan it to open the latest laboratory test report for that product — moisture content, butyric acid levels, antibiotic test results, heavy metal levels, and adulteration markers — tested by Jagdamba Laboratories, Jaipur, a Government-approved ISO 9001:2015 and GLP-certified laboratory. Every production batch is tested before it reaches you. When a new batch report is available, we update the page the QR links to. Real data, visible to anyone before or after they buy. If purity proof matters to you, scan the QR and decide for yourself.",
      },
      {
        question: "Why is Vara more expensive than regular supermarket ghee?",
        answer:
          "Three reasons. First, the bilona method: hand-churning curd into butter and slow-cooking on wood fire takes significantly more time and labour than machine-separated cream processing. Second, independent laboratory testing: every batch is tested across 70+ parameters at Jagdamba Laboratories before it ships. Third, direct sourcing: we work directly with the farm with no brokers or aggregators, and the farm charges fairly for genuine quality.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is Vara certified organic?",
        answer:
          "Our ghee and honey supplier — a family farm in Kota, Rajasthan — is currently in organic conversion under India's National Programme for Organic Production Standards (NPOP), certified by the Rajasthan State Organic Certification Agency (RSOCA). In-conversion means the farm is transitioning to certified organic but has not yet received final certification. We do not claim or print the words Certified Organic on our labels or website because that would be inaccurate.",
      },
      {
        question: "Why should I trust a new brand with no reviews yet?",
        answer:
          "You should not trust us just because we say so. Trust us because you can verify us. Scan the QR code on your jar to see the laboratory report, and check our FSSAI licence at foscos.fssai.gov.in using number 11226998000505. We are new, and we will not pretend otherwise. What we have is verified supply and published lab reports. Judge us on that.",

      {
        question: "What is bilona ghee?",
        answer:
          "Bilona ghee is made by the traditional method — curd is first churned by hand into butter using a wooden churner called a bilona, and this butter is then slow-cooked on wood fire to produce ghee. This is the method described in Ayurvedic texts. It is fundamentally different from commercial ghee, where cream is mechanically separated from milk and then clarified — a faster, cheaper method that skips the curd and churning steps entirely.",
      },
      {
        question: "What is A2 milk and why does it matter?",
        answer:
          "All cow milk contains beta-casein protein. A2 cows — including native Indian breeds such as Gir, Sahiwal, and Rathi — produce milk with only A2 beta-casein. Most commercial dairy cows in India today are crossbred Holstein-Friesian varieties that produce A1 beta-casein. Research suggests A2 milk may be easier to digest for some people. Our ghee is made from A2 milk from Gir, Sahiwal, and Marwadi cows raised on the farm in Kota, Rajasthan.",
      },

        question: "What does butyric acid content of 3.82% mean?",
        answer:
          "Butyric acid (C4:0) is a short-chain fatty acid found naturally in ghee. It is an important marker used when assessing ghee quality. Our current batch report shows 3.82%. Scan the QR on the jar to review the complete report and the latest verified batch values.",
      },
      {
        question: "What does moisture content of 0.09% mean?",
        answer:
          "FSSAI standards require ghee moisture to be below 0.5%. A result of 0.09% is well below that limit. Lower moisture supports longer shelf life and indicates that the ghee was cooked without excess water remaining. Scan the QR on your jar for the latest batch value.",
      },
      {
        question: "Why does Vara ghee smell different from supermarket ghee?",
        answer:
          "Genuine bilona ghee made from A2 curd has a stronger, nuttier, more complex aroma than commercial ghee. The bilona process and wood-fire cooking preserve flavour compounds differently from machine processing. A stronger aroma is not necessarily a defect; it is a natural characteristic of traditionally made ghee.",
      },
      {
        question: "How should I store ghee?",
        answer:
          "Store it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Ghee does not need refrigeration and should ideally be kept at room temperature. Always use a dry spoon, because introducing moisture shortens shelf life. Properly stored Vara ghee has a shelf life of 12 months from the manufacturing date.",
      },
      {
        question: "Why is my ghee granular or semi-solid?",
        answer:
          "Ghee naturally transitions between liquid and solid states depending on temperature. In cooler weather or air-conditioned rooms it becomes granular or fully solid; in warm weather it becomes liquid. This is normal and does not indicate a quality issue. Gently warm the jar in warm water if you prefer liquid ghee.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is Vara ghee suitable during pregnancy?",
        answer:
          "This question is what started Vara. Our founder could not find ghee she could trust during her pregnancy, so she built this brand. A2 bilona ghee is a traditional food, but individual dietary needs differ. Always consult your doctor for specific dietary guidance during pregnancy.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is Vara ghee suitable for lactose-intolerant people?",
        answer:
          "Ghee is made by clarifying butter — removing milk solids and water — leaving behind almost pure fat. The clarification process removes most lactose and casein, and many people who are lactose intolerant can tolerate ghee. Individual tolerance varies, so consult your doctor before use if you are severely lactose intolerant.",

        question: "What is raw honey and how is it different from regular honey?",
        answer:
          "Raw honey is collected from natural forest beehives and is not heated above ambient temperature or fine-filtered. Regular commercial honey may be heated for bottling, fine-filtered to remove pollen and wax, or blended. Our honey is unheated, minimally strained to remove debris, and bottled as close to its natural state as possible.",
      },
      {
        question: "Why does my honey look dark and thick?",
        answer:
          "Natural raw forest honey is often darker and thicker than commercial honey because it is unfiltered and unheated. The colour and thickness vary with the flowers the bees feed on. Forest honey from diverse wildflowers is typically darker than single-source honey, and this natural variation does not indicate lower quality.",
      },
      {
        question: "Why is my honey crystallised?",
        answer:
          "Crystallisation is a natural process in raw honey as glucose separates from water over time. To re-liquefy it, place the jar in warm water below 40°C and stir gently. Never microwave honey.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is this honey suitable for infants?",
        answer:
          "No. Honey of any kind — raw or processed — should not be given to children under 12 months old because of the risk of infant botulism. This recommendation applies regardless of the honey's quality or source.",

        answer:
          "Wood pressed oil — also called wooden ghani oil — is extracted by slowly crushing oilseeds in a traditional wooden mortar and pestle. The process keeps extraction temperatures relatively low and preserves the oilseed's natural flavour, colour, and nutritional compounds.",
      },
      {
        question: "Why does wood pressed oil look darker than refined oil?",
        answer:
          "Wood pressed oil is not refined, bleached, or deodorised. Those industrial processes remove colour and aroma to produce a pale, neutral-smelling product. The darker colour and stronger aroma of wood pressed oil are natural characteristics of an unrefined product, not quality problems.",
      },
      {
        question: "Why does my wood pressed oil have sediment?",
        answer:
          "Wood pressed oil may have natural sediment from the oilseed. This is normal and safe. It indicates that the oil has not been filtered to the degree that removes all natural compounds. Shake gently before use, or allow the sediment to settle and pour the clear oil.",

        question: "Is wood pressed sesame oil the same as gingelly oil?",

      },
      {
        question: "Can I use these oils for high-heat cooking?",
        answer:
          "Wood pressed groundnut oil has a reasonably high smoke point and is suitable for most cooking, including stir-frying and shallow frying. Wood pressed sesame oil has a lower smoke point and is best used for tempering, dressings, and light cooking. Our wood pressed oils are best suited to everyday home cooking at moderate heat.",

          "Our ghee and honey supplier operates a family farm in Kota, Rajasthan, with Gir, Sahiwal, and Marwadi cows raised on 10 hectares of land. We have personally verified the farm. The animals are stall-fed and pasture-fed, with no artificial hormones or antibiotics; antibiotic screening is included in batch testing.",

      {
        question: "Do you use child labour or exploit farm workers?",
        answer:
          "No. We work directly with a family-owned farm and a traditional wooden ghani facility. Both are small operations where the owners are directly involved in production. We have visited both facilities and are confident in their working conditions.",
