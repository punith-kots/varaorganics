Vara's A2 Gir Cow Bilona Ghee is hand-churned from cultured curd into butter, then slow-cooked on a wood fire into golden ghee. No centrifuge, no shortcuts — the bilona method your grandmother would recognise.

## Why bilona matters

Industrial ghee is separated by machine from cream. Bilona ghee begins with curd, is hand-churned, and slow-simmered. The result is a grainy texture, a nutty aroma, and a flavour that machine ghee cannot replicate.

### Sourcing

Made from the milk of A2 Gir cows raised on known farms in Rajasthan. Traceable to a single source — not aggregated from unknown suppliers.

### Testing

Every batch is independently NABL lab-tested before it ships. Scan the QR on your jar to see the exact report for the batch in your hand.`,
