    bodyMarkdown: `Bilona ghee is made the slow, traditional way — from cultured curd, hand-churned into butter, then simmered into ghee.

# The bilona method, step by step

First, milk is cultured into curd. The curd is churned (the "bilona" is the churning staff) into butter. That butter is then slow-cooked over a controlled flame until it becomes golden ghee.

## Why not just separate cream?

Most commercial ghee skips curd entirely: cream is machine-separated from milk and cooked. Bilona starts from curd, which changes the aroma, texture and flavour.

# How to recognise real bilona ghee

Look for a grainy texture, a strong nutty aroma, and — most importantly — a batch-specific lab report you can verify.

You should never have to take "pure" on trust. Scan the QR on the jar and read the report for your exact batch.`,

Indian-origin (desi) breeds like Gir typically produce milk with A2 beta-casein. Many high-yield crossbreeds produce A1 or a mix.

# Does it matter for ghee?

Ghee is almost entirely fat, so protein content is minimal in the final product. People choose A2 primarily for sourcing and breed reasons rather than a proven nutritional difference in ghee.

Sourcing transparency, the making method, and independent lab testing matter more than marketing labels. Always verify the batch report.`,

# Step 2: Look for adulteration markers

Check that adulteration and foreign-fat markers read "Not detected" or "Negative".

# Step 3: Review the fatty-acid profile

Butyric acid and Reichert value indicate genuine dairy ghee. Values within expected ranges suggest authenticity.

# Step 4: Confirm contaminants are absent

Antibiotics and heavy metals should read "Not detected".

Cold-pressed usually means a steel expeller run at controlled temperatures. It's still an improvement over refined oil, but the equipment and speed differ from a ghani.

Seeds are placed in a wooden mortar. A wooden pestle, historically driven by bullocks and now often by a slow motor, crushes and presses them, releasing oil gradually.

# Why the wood matters

The slow rotation and wooden contact keep temperatures moderate compared with fast industrial extraction, helping preserve flavour and natural nutrients.

Ghani pressing yields less oil per batch and takes longer — which is exactly why it produces small-batch, full-flavoured oil.`,
