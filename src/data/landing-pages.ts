 *    (₹799 / ₹2,699). The catalog is authoritative for anything charged; these
 *    strings are display copy only and must be reconciled.
 *  - The comparison table names competitors with prices and "Not published"
 *    claims. Comparative advertising needs dated evidence on file.
 *  - Lab/accreditation names (Jagdamba Laboratories, ISO 9001:2015, GLP) and
 *    farm details are owner-supplied and must be substantiated.
